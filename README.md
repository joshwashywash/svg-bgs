# svg background generator

![examble background](./static/example.svg)

## quick rundown

- The application is hosted at https://josho.dev/svg-bgs.
- The backgrounds are implemented using [svg pattern elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Patterns).
- The svgs have a viewBox of `0 0 1 1`. In other words, the aspect ratio is 1/1.
- The svgs are intended to be used as backgrounds so `width` nor `height` is specified.
- This is a work-in-progress. If you have suggestions, please open a github issue.
